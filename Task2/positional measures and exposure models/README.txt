## Overview

This folder contains R codes to employ the network affiliation model, network exposure model, and to compute the network positional and centrality measures. Here we briefly summarize the procedures and how the code works.

### `affiliation network exposure.R`

This R script contains the code to compute the affiliation network exposure. The step-by-step procedures are outline within the .R file. For the final reporting of the project, we utilized the data for the delta-period, which we defiend as epedemiological weeks 14-35 of 2021. For future use, the input data can be adjusted to compute measures for different periods.

### `positional measures and centralities.R`

This R script contains the code to compute the various network positional and centrality measures, such as the degree distribution, network density, global betweenness annd closeness measures, and others. The step-by-step procedures are outline within the .R file. To demonstrate the computations, we have included a section to generate a synthetic network within the R code. The code also demonstrates the computations of these measures for the simulated network.
